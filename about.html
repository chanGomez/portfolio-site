         <h1>My name is Chantal Gomez.</h1>
        <p class="bio-paragraph">  I am a Pursuit fellow with experience
            in graphic design. My journey into software engineering began
            when my web design 101 class required me to make my own
            professional website. It opened a whole new world I didn't know
            was there. A career advisor suggested I take some coding so I
            decided to take the leap. My skills include correctly
            communicating ideas and messages through visual concepts. With
            my coding journey I currently know algorithms with javascript
            and html with css for front end and back end developing. Given
            my passion for design and problem solving I stay eager to
            satisfy my needs for creating functional easy to use beautiful
            websites. I am currently working to understand the general topic
            of api and how I can use it to my advantage when creating
            websites and personal projects to build for my portfolio.</p>
